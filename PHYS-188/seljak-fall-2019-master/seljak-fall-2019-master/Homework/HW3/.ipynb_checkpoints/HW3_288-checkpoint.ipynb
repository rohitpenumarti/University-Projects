    "UMAP can be used as an effective preprocessing step to boost the performance of density based clustering. This is somewhat controversial, and should be attempted with care. For a good discussion of some of the issues involved in this please see the various answers in this stackoverflow thread (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/263539/clustering-on-the-output-of-t-sne) on clustering the results of t-SNE. Many of the points of concern raised there are salient for clustering the results of UMAP. The most notable is that UMAP, like t-SNE, does not completely preserve density. UMAP, like t-SNE, can also create tears in clusters that are not actually present, resulting in a finer clustering than is necessarily present in the data. Despite these concerns there are still valid reasons to use UMAP as a preprocessing step for clustering. As with any clustering approach one will want to do some exploration and evaluation of the clusters that come out to try to validate them if possible.\n",
